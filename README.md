# Sync-with-LBRY
A nodeJS app to Sync your YouTube Channel with LBRY, without any API dependencies!

### Explained

----

Currently to sync LBRY/Odysee you have to rely on LBRY Inc APIs and often there's a long queue as large number of creators are syncing everyday [That's a good thing!].
To take some pressure off the Team and Handing you the Power of Syncing, this app automates the process of your metadata and videos as well as publish them to LBRY and Odysee.
You just need to have a enough amount of LBC!
